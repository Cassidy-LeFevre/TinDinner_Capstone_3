# TinDinner_Capstone_3
This is  Full Stack application that uses Java and Spring framework for the backend, and React and CSS for the front end. My role was focused mainly on backend, while collaborating with and supporting my front end teammates. Excluding the login, I wrote the backend as well as the SQL. 

To run:
Run the backend. Go to final-capstone-restaurant-tinder -> java -> src -> main -> java -> com.techelevator and runn the Application. 
Run the front end using npm-- in Vs Code, use npm install and npm start.
